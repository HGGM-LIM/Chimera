# The Chimera and Gaggle Algorithms
The Chimera Algorithm is a novel Neural Architecture Search method able to generate and evolve the architecture of feedforward Convolutional Neural Networks based on the adaptation of the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm to work within an Evolutionary Computation framework. The Gaggle Algorithm is an extension of the Chimera Algorithm that combines the populations generated into ensembles.

There is an example of the Chimera and the Gaggle Algorithms tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and another one tested on an problem of biomedical interest. The latter requires a dataset that will be provided at the camera-ready version through Google Drive, not provided yet to preserve anonymity.
